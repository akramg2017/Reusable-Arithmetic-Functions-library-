# Reusable-Arithmetic-Functions-library-
This library of arithmetic functions. It supports basic operations Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Square Root, Exponent, and Conversion. and performs arithmetic operations on numbers like integers, floating point, octal, binary, and hexadecimal.

Getting Started

This App works to operate the basic function, first start with select the type of values for operation after we run the app message show for select "what type of values you will inter integer 1, double 2, binary 3, octal 4, and hexadecimal 5, please press enter after you chose", then we insert the first value. After we insert the first value, the message of select operation will appear "chose your type of operation: Addition 1, Subtraction 2, Multiplication 3, Division 4, Exponent 5, Square Root 6, Conversion 7, Delete 8, End 9 please press inter after you chose". So we chose the operation and then the second value and the app will respond depends on the operation and the type of values we selected.

Library For Reusable

This library was designed to be reusable, so most of the function and sub-procedure developed in manner of reuse, and I use some function in this application many time during the run time as example when I use insert values I call function "valueType" this function have to duty insert the value and convert values type. And I designed my appellation as main function calling other function for any operation types so in total I have 7 function and 2 sub-procedure. So we can call this function in this or other application and reuse them. In general, anyone can inject this module "ArithmeticFunctions" to his application and with some changes in the main () sub-procedure and provide your own values from the different resource it would work fun.
